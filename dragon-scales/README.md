# Dragon Scales



## Quickstart

This module is meant to be run using the docker-compose file in the parent of this repository. But if you are trying to run this in development mode, follow the following steps:

Firstly we need to install [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

Second, simply run `npm run dev` in this directory. As long as you have a proper `.env` file in this path, the dev server should start.
