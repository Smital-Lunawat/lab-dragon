# Known Issues

- If the notebook cannot find some path reference, there should be some way of handling instead of just crashing.
- comments should be refactored to remove comment types
- I need to add comments in convertes to specify what each section of the code is doing. 
- I need a list of a systematic way of testing the curent feautres of the website and code, to make sure everything is working as expected.
- If the entity is not long enough the text in the buttons gets smaller and runs off in the background
- The enetity component of the webapp should handle loaiding its own data and its children from the server not the other way around.
